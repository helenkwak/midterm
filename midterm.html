	<p><i><b>Cowboy Bebop</b> (カウボーイビバップ Kaubōi Bibappu)</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" target="_blank">Japanese animated</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" target="_blank">science-fiction</a> television series animated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(company)" target="_blank">Sunrise</a> featuring a production team led by director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinichir%C5%8D_Watanabe" target="_blank">Shinichirō Watanabe</a>, screenwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_Nobumoto" target="_blank">Keiko Nobumoto</a>, character designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshihiro_Kawamoto" target="_blank">Toshihiro Kawamoto</a>, mechanical designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimitoshi_Yamane" target="_blank">Kimitoshi Yamane</a>, and composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Kanno" target="_blank">Yoko Kanno</a>. The twenty-six episodes ("sessions") of the series are set in the year 2071, and follow the lives of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter" target="_blank">bounty hunter</a> crew traveling in their spaceship called the Bebop. Although it covers a wide range of genres throughout its run, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> draws most heavily from science fiction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)#Film" target="_blank">western</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" target="_blank">noir</a> films, and its most recurring thematic focal points include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult" target="_blank">adult</a> <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boredom" target="_blank">existential ennui</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness" target="_blank">loneliness</a> and the difficulties of trying to escape one's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past" target="_blank">past</a>.</p>

	<p>The series premiered in Japan on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Tokyo" target="_blank">TV Tokyo</a> from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wowow" target="_blank">Wowow</a> from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga" target="_blank">manga</a> series which were serialized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Shoten" target="_blank">Kadokawa Shoten</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monthly_Asuka_Fantasy_DX" target="_blank"><i>Asuka Fantasy DX</i></a>. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop:_The_Movie" target="_blank">film</a> was later released to theaters worldwide.</p>

	<p>The anime series was dubbed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" target="_blank">English language</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaze" target="_blank">Animaze</a> and ZRO Limit Productions, and was licensed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai_Visual#Bandai_Entertainment" target="_blank">Bandai Entertainment</a> in North America and is now licensed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funimation" target="_blank">Funimation</a>.

In 2001, Cowboy Bebop became the first anime title to be broadcast on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim" target="_blank">Adult Swim in the United States</a>.</p>

	<p>Cowboy Bebop became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets (most notably in the United States), garnered several major anime and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_science_fiction#Science_fiction_awards" target="_blank">science fiction</a> awards upon its release, and received wide acclaim for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics have hailed Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime titles of all time. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, Cowboy Bebop has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>In 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as "Cowboys") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship Bebop. The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and his partner Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward Wong, an eccentric girl skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically-engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence. Over the course of the series, the team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting faces and events from their past: these include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP, and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.</p>
	<p>The main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious, an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon Syndicate. Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, but when Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend Julia and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her, Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia goes into hiding to protect herself and Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to complete their plan. Vicious, having staged a coup d'état and taken over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. His heartbreak feeds his desire to kill Vicious once and for all. Spike leaves the Bebop after saying a final goodbye to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to be mortally wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation. The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun. He eventually falls to the ground.</p>

	<p>Watanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it "a new genre unto itself". The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts. Later, Watanabe called the phrase an "exaggeration". The show is a hybrid of multiple genres, including the Western and pulp fiction. One reviewer described it as "space opera meets noir, meets comedy, meets cyberpunk". It has also been called a "genre-bursting space western."</p>
	<p>The musical style was emphasized in many of the episode titles. Multiple philosophical themes are explored using the characters, including existentialism, existential ennui, loneliness, and the effect of the past on the protagonists. The series also makes specific references to or pastiches multiple films, including the works of John Woo and Bruce Lee, Midnight Run, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Alien. The series also includes extensive references and elements from science fiction, bearing strong similarities to the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson. Several planets and space stations in the series are made in Earth's image. The streets of celestial objects such as Ganymede resemble a modern port city, while Mars features shopping malls, theme parks, casinos and cities. Cowboy Bebop's universe is filled with video players and hyperspace gates, eco-politics and fairgrounds, spaceships and Native American shamans. This setting has been described as "one part Chinese diaspora and two parts wild west."</p>

	<p>The characters were created by Watanabe and character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto. Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality, or as an opposite person to himself. Each character, from the main cast to supporting characters, were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society. Kawamoto designed the characters so they were easily distinguished from one another. All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past. From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis, the main characters resemble the main characters of the anime series Lupin III, if only superficially, given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalities.<p>
	<p>The show focuses on the character of Spike Spiegel, with the overall theme of the series being Spike's past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as someone who had lost his expectations for the future, having lost the woman he loved, and so was in a near-constant lethargy. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>Cowboy Bebop was developed by animation studio Sunrise and created by Hajime Yatate, the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff. The leader of the series' creative team was director Shinichirō Watanabe, most notable at the time for directing Macross Plus and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory. Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane, composer Yoko Kanno, and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei. Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles. Nobumoto had scripted Macross Plus, Kawamoto had designed the characters for Gundam, and Kanno had composed the music for Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne. Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included Bubblegum Crisis and The Vision of Escaflowne. Minami joined the project as he wanted to do something different from his previous work on mecha anime.</p>

	<h4>Manga</h4>
		<p class="paragraph_text_up">Two Cowboy Bebop manga series have been released, both published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in Asuka Fantasy DX. The first manga series, titled Shooting Star Bebop and illustrated by Cain Kuga, was serialized from October issue 1997, before the anime series' release, to July issue 1998. It was collected into two volumes in 1998, the first one in May and the second one in September. The second manga series, simply titled Cowboy Bebop and illustrated by Yutaka Nanten, was serialized from November issue 1998 to March issue 2000. It was collected into three volumes, the first two in April and October 1999 and the third one in April 2000. Both manga series were licensed by Tokyopop for release in North America.

	<h4>Video Games</h4>
		<p class="paragraph_text_up">A Cowboy Bebop video game, developed and published by Bandai, was released in Japan for the PlayStation on May 14, 1998. A PlayStation 2 video game, Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade, was released in Japan on August 25, 2005, and an English version had been set for release in North America. However, in January 2007, IGN reported that the release had likely been cancelled, speculating that it did not survive Bandai Namco's merger to Bandai Namco Games.</p>

	<h4>Film</h4>
		<p class="paragraph_text_up">An anime film titled Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, also known as Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door (カウボーイビバップ 天国の扉 Kaubōi Bibappu: Tengoku no Tobira), was released in Japan in September 2001 and in the United States in 2003.</p>

		<p class="paragraph_text_up">On July 22, 2008, If published an article on its website regarding a rumor of a live-action Cowboy Bebop movie in development by 20th Century Fox. Producer Erwin Stoff said that the film's development was in the early stages, and that they had "just signed it". Keanu Reeves was to play the role of Spike Spiegel. Variety confirmed on January 15, 2009 that production company Sunrise Animation would be "closely involved with the development of the English-language project". The site also confirmed Kenji Uchida, Shinichirō Watanabe and series writer Keiko Nobumoto as associate producers, series producer Masahiko Minami as a production consultant, and Peter Craig as screenwriter. This was lauded by various sources as a promising move for the potential quality of the film. At the time it was slated to release in 2011, but problems with the budget delayed its production. The submitted script was sent back for rewrite to reduce the cost and little has been heard about it since an interview with producer Joshua Long on October 15, 2010; the project currently languishes in development hell. On October 25, 2014, series director Watanabe was asked about the live-action film at the MCM London Comicon. He stated: "I'm afraid I don't know what they're thinking in Hollywood. Apparently the project hasn't come to a stop but I don't know how it's going to progress from here on. I hear that there are a lot of 'Hollywood' problems."</p>

		<p>After the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more Cowboy Bebop material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he "should just keep on making Cowboy Bebop sequels for the sake of it". Watanabe added that ending production and "to quit while we're ahead when people still want more" is more "in keeping with the Bebop spirit". In a more recent interview from 2006 with The Daily Texan, Watanabe was asked if there would ever be more Cowboy Bebop. Watanabe's answer was "someday...maybe, someday".</p>
